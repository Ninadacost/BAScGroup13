State Population (broken down by racial demographic)(2019):

Quick facts is a website providing statistics gathered from various U.S Census Bureau censuses, surveys and programs. By using tables and selecting facts we narrowed down the data for the population type, years and geographic location we wished to explore. This allowed us to break down the racial demographics by state. 

 Limitations of Census data: 
-Many different sources which could have a variety of definitions for each term and vary in terms of referencing periods.
-Some data is based on complete enumerations whilst others rely on sampling. The results can vary from very precise to “informed guesses”.
